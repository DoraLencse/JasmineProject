# Project Overview

This is my 5th Udacity Project which I made within Google - Udacity Front- End Web Dev Nanodegree Program. 
In this project I wrote tests to the given web-based application using Jasmine framework.

## How to run the application?
* Download my repository from [here](https://github.com/DoraLencse/JasmineProject) and open the index.htm file in a browser.
* Living [demo]([https://doralencse.github.io/JasmineProject/)

## My Project

I tested the given web-based application step by step in order to fulfill this Udacity Project requirements.

* My test makes sure that the allFeeds variable has been defined and that it is not empty.
* My test loops through each feed in the `allFeeds` object and ensures it has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.
* My test loops through each feed in the `allFeeds` object and ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not empty.
* My test ensures the menu element is hidden by default.
* My test ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked
* My test ensures when the `loadFeed` function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single `.entry` element within the `.feed` container.
* My test ensures when a new feed is loaded by the `loadFeed` function that the content actually changes.
